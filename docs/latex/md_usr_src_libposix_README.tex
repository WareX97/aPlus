The C P\+O\+S\+I\+X library is a specification of a C standard library for P\+O\+S\+I\+X systems. It was developed at the same time as the A\+N\+S\+I C standard. Some effort was made to make P\+O\+S\+I\+X compatible with standard C; P\+O\+S\+I\+X includes additional functions to those introduced in standard C.
